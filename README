This program's purpose is, to provide for my website visitors a MS-Word 
document with same form but different contents.

For example, somebody has a website for his/her own take-out restaurant.
The customer can order take-out menus on the website, and the owner wants
to get order paper formed MS-Word file.
So, if the owner makes a form once, the owner would receive same format order papers from customers.
